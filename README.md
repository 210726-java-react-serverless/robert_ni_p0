# Project 0
For Project 0, you will be building a console-based student management application. Presentation date: August 11th, 2021


## User Stories

As a faculty member I can:
- [ ] add new classes to the registration catalog
- [ ] change the registration details for a class
- [ ] remove a class from the registration catalog (this should unregister all registered students)

As a student, I can:
- [ ] register a new account with the system (must be secured with a password)
- [ ] login with my existing credentials
- [ ] view classes available for registration
- [ ] register for an open and available class
- [ ] cancel my registration for a class (if within window)
- [ ] view the classes that I have registered for

## Minimum Features
- [ ] Basic validation (e.g. no registration for classes outside of registration window, etc.) 
- [ ] Unit tests for all business-logic classes
- [ ] All exceptions are properly caught and handled
- [ ] Proper use of OOP principles
- [ ] Documentation (all classes and methods have basic documentation)
- [ ] Referential integrity (e.g. if a class is removed from the catalog, no students should be registered for it)
- [ ] Logging messages and exceptions to a file using a Java logging framework (e.g. Log4J2, SLF4J, etc.)


## Tech Stack
- [ ] Java 8
- [ ] Apache Maven
- [ ] MongoDB
- [ ] Git SCM (hosted on GitHub)


## Init Instructions
- Create a new repository within this organization (naming convention: `firstname_lastname_p0`)


## Presentation
- [ ] finalized version of application must be pushed to personal repository within this organization by the presentation date
- [ ] 5 minute live demonstration of the implemented features
